# ESD-Ant-Colony-Simulation

The goal of this project is to create a map of the ESD campus and to use the Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm to figure out the fastest and most efficient ways around the campus. It will have additional mechanisms in place to simulate events where numerous people are walking to different targets at the same time, and it will be able to find general metrics about the schoolâ€™s transportation infrastructure.

This will be done in primarily three parts: create the algorithm behind the simulation, apply the simulation to a map of ESD, and create an effective GUI for the program that shows the simulation and all relevant information. No one person will take all of a task, but they will be done between both people.
